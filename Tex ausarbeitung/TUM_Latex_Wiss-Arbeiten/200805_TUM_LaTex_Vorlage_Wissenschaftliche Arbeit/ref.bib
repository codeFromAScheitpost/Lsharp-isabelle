	abstract = {The problem of identifying an unknown regular set from examples of its members and nonmembers is addressed. It is assumed that the regular set is presented by a minimally adequate Teacher, which can answer membership queries about the set and can also test a conjecture and indicate whether it is equal to the unknown set and provide a counterexample if not. (A counterexample is a string in the symmetric difference of the correct set and the conjectured set.) A learning algorithm L∗ is described that correctly learns any regular set from any minimally adequate Teacher in time polynomial in the number of states of the minimum dfa for the set and the maximum length of any counterexample provided by the Teacher. It is shown that in a stochastic setting the ability of the Teacher to test conjectures may be replaced by a random sampling oracle, EX( ). A polynomial-time learning algorithm is shown for a particular problem of context-free language identification.}

	abstract = {A Teacher knows a regular language L(G), in the form of a finite state acceptor. A method is described for selecting a set of examples, strings X, each in L(G) as inputs to the Pupil. The Set X is mapped into a lattice W (in Pupil) of finite state machines. A mapping is defined from pairs of machines in the lattice W into strings y, each of which serves as a ”crucial experiment”. The Teacher is asked to decide if the string y belongs to L(G). The process then repeats or terminates. This procedure is shown to converge (if Teacher answers truthfully) to a finite state acceptor accepting only strings of L(G)(which obviously may be brought into canonical, minimal state form). However, this process does not depend on state minimization as an inference method. The only necessary condition for the inference process is that every move (edge) of that finite state acceptor U(X) chosen to correspond to L(G) must be applied at least once in generating some string x in X. A proof is given that if the Teacher answers correctly, the Pupil will infer a machine behaviorally equivalent to the original acceptor U. Elements of the lattice W are constructed by successive refinement of the partitions of the state set of the initial finite state machine U(X). Pairs are chosen in an ordered process and converted to deterministic and completely specified machines, if necessary. The two machines are tested for behavioral equivalence. If they are equivalent, one is eliminated. If not, a testing string y belonging to one machine, but not the other, is constructed and output to the teacher. If y belongs to L(G), one machine is eliminated. If not, y is tested by the Pupil against a sequence of machines generated internally. If only one machine is left, the process terminates, otherwise two new candidate machines are chosen. The algorithm described is relatively simple and easy to understand, but does not necessarily produce a minimal time solution.}

We are interested in the combination of these techniques. Namely, we would like to be able to test whether an implementation with unknown structure satisfies some given properties. We propose and formalize this problem of black box checking and suggest several algorithms. Since the input to black box checking is not given initially, as is the case in the classical model of computation, but is learned through experiments, we propose a computational model based on games with incomplete information. We use this model to analyze the complexity of the problem. We also address the more practical question of finding an approach that can detect errors in the implementation before completing an exhaustive search.",

	abstract="In this paper we present TTT, a novel active automata learning algorithm formulated in the Minimally Adequate Teacher (MAT) framework. The distinguishing characteristic of TTT is its redundancy-free organization of observations, which can be exploited to achieve optimal (linear) space complexity. This is thanks to a thorough analysis of counterexamples, extracting and storing only the essential refining information. TTT is therefore particularly well-suited for application in a runtime verification context, where counterexamples (obtained, e.g., via monitoring) may be excessively long: as the execution time of a test sequence typically grows with its length, this would otherwise cause severe performance degradation. We illustrate the impact of TTT's consequent redundancy-free approach along a number of examples.",

	abstract = {We present new algorithms for inferring an unknown finite-state automaton from its input/output behavior, even in the absence of a means of resetting the machine to a start state. A key technique used is inference of a homing sequence for the unknown automaton. Our inference procedures experiment with the unknown machine, and from time to time require a teacher to supply counterexamples to incorrect conjectures about the structure of the unknown automaton. In this setting, we describe a learning algorithm that, with probability 1 − δ, outputs a correct description of the unknown machine in time polynomial in the automaton′s size, the length of the longest counterexample, and log(1/δ). We present an analogous algorithm that makes use of a diversity-based representation of the finite-state system. Our algorithms are the first which are provably effective for these problems, in the absence of a "reset." We also present probabilistic algorithms for permutation automata which do not require a teacher to supply counterexamples. For inferring a permutation automaton of diversity D, we improve the best previous time bound by roughly a factor of D3/log D.}

Thanks to its adherence to the so-called `LCF approach', the system can be extended with new inference rules without compromising soundness. While retaining this reliability and programmability from earlier HOL systems, HOL Light is distinguished by its clean and simple design and extremely small logical kernel. Despite this, it provides powerful proof tools and has been applied to some non-trivial tasks in the formalization of mathematics and industrial formal verification.",

We assume correctness of compiler, assembly code, and hardware, and we used a unique design approach that fuses formal and operating systems techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first formal proof of functional correctness of a complete, general-purpose operating-system kernel. Functional correctness means here that the implementation always strictly follows our high-level abstract specification of kernel behaviour. This encompasses traditional design and implementation safety properties such as the kernel will never crash, and it will never perform an unsafe operation. It also proves much more: we can predict precisely how the kernel will behave in every possible situation.seL4, a third-generation microkernel of L4 provenance, comprises 8,700 lines of C code and 600 lines of assembler. Its performance is comparable to other high-performance L4 kernels.},
